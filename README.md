# Classification of weather using CNN and deep learning


Weather plays a huge part in day to day life, from
destroying crops to affecting people’s commute it affects every
individual by one way or another. Generally, in traditional
methods we always make use of expensive sensors and human
involvement to detect the weather. It often ends up giving results
with low accuracy. There’s also a constraint on the availability of
human resources and expensive instruments .Hence to save the
human efforts and instruments the new approach of classifying
the approach has been proposed. This approach involves use of
computer vision and machine learning to classify the weather
condition based on the image. We can make use of surveillance
cameras which are readily available to get the image of the
outdoors and detect the weather based on the Image and time.
